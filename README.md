# Web Vulnerability Assessment Using OWASP ZAP

## Overview
This project documents a web application vulnerability assessment conducted using **OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)** against an intentionally vulnerable application (DVWA) hosted on a local virtual machine.  
The exercise was performed as part of hands-on security training to gain practical experience in automated scanning, vulnerability analysis, and security documentation.

## Environment
- Operating System: Kali Linux
- Target Application: Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)
- Scanner: OWASP ZAP
- Target URL: http://172.17.0.2/dvwa

## Objectives
- Perform an automated vulnerability scan
- Identify and review discovered security issues
- Investigate a high-risk vulnerability using OWASP WSTG

> This assessment was conducted in a controlled lab environment for educational purposes only.
